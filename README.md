# Banking Management System

## Overview
This C++ Banking Management System is a comprehensive project developed during the 3rd semester for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) term project. The system is designed to manage various banking operations efficiently. It incorporates advanced features such as the use of pointers, linked list data structures, and a well-organized CLI (Command Line Interface) for user interaction.

## Features
- **User Management:**
  - Create, delete, and modify customer accounts.
  - Store and retrieve customer information using linked lists.
  - Utilize pointers for efficient memory management.

- **Account Operations:**
  - Deposit and withdraw funds from accounts.
  - Check balance and account details.
  - View transaction history.

- **Security:**
  - Implement secure login functionality.
  - Password protection for customer accounts.

- **CLI Interface:**
  - Intuitive and user-friendly command line interface.
  - Easy navigation through the system's functionalities.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Implementation of linked lists for managing customer accounts.
  - Proper use of pointers for optimized memory usage.

## Project Structure
- `main.cpp`: The main C++ file containing the program's code.
- `Banking Management System.exe`: The executable to run the program.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the banking system.

## Note
This project was developed during the 3rd semester as a term project for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or use it as a reference for your own projects.
